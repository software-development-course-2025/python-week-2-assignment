# 🧾 Python List Operations

This Python script demonstrates common list operations such as adding, inserting, extending, sorting, and finding elements.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Creates an empty list  
2. Appends values: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`  
3. Inserts `15` at the second position  
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`  
5. Removes the last element  
6. Sorts the list in ascending order  
7. Finds the index of value `30` and prints it

## 💡 Example Output

Index of 30: 4  
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
